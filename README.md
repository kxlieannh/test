### ⚙️ Usage Policy

1. **Test Environment Only**

   * Scripts here are meant for testing in *non-production* systems unless explicitly approved for release.
   * Always verify script safety in isolated or virtualized environments before production use.

2. **Data Sensitivity**

   * Do **not** commit any confidential, proprietary, or user-identifiable data.
   * Replace sensitive values (e.g., IPs, credentials, server names) with placeholders.

3. **Security Practices**

   * All scripts must follow least privilege principles.
   * No hard-coded credentials, tokens, or API keys allowed.
   * Use environment variables or secure credential stores instead.

4. **Version Control & Review**

   * Commit messages should clearly describe changes.
   * Major script changes or new tools should go through a pull request review before merge.
   * Tag stable versions with release notes when applicable.

5. **Logging & Auditing**

   * Log relevant actions for traceability.
   * Avoid including any sensitive data in logs.
